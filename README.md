# graphql-example
Two types of create a graphQL servers (schema first and code first)


## First example: simple-server.ts

In this graphQL example, we build a simple schema first approach application, where the file consists of building the schemas for our data structures and coding the Querys and Mutations later.

## Second exampel: src/server.ts

 In this other example we have already covered a different way of coding, using the code first approach.
This approach involves developing our DTO's, Resolvers and type-graphql automatically generates the schemas for us in a file called **schemas.gql**.
